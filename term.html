We are committed to providing our guests with exceptional travel experiences, delivered with transparency and care. Please read the following terms carefully before confirming your booking. These guidelines help protect both you and TravelCove throughout your journey.

*🧾 Booking & Payment Policy*
Quotation Validity:
All quotations issued by TravelCove are valid for 30 calendar days from the date of issue. After this period, prices and availability may be subject to change.

Advance Payment Requirement:
To confirm your booking, a 50% advance payment of the total tour package amount is required. This ensures that hotel rooms, transportation, attraction tickets, and other services are secured.

Final Balance Payment:
The remaining 50% must be paid at least 15 days before your scheduled departure. For last-minute bookings (within 15 days), 100% payment is required upon confirmation.

Payment Methods
We accept payments via bank transfer, credit card, or cash (in AED). For international payments, any associated transfer fees are the responsibility of the guest.

Pricing Notice
All prices quoted are based on the prevailing rates at the time of quotation. Prices are subject to change based on factors such as currency fluctuations, supplier costs, government regulations, or seasonal demand.

Last-Minute Bookings
Bookings made less than 7 days prior to departure are considered urgent and may be subject to rush charges or limited availability.

Reason for cancellation (optional)

You will receive a confirmation email from our support team within 24 hours, along with your refund status and estimated processing time.

Refunds are processed via the original payment method used during booking.

TravelCove does not charge any refund processing fee.

🔁 Rescheduling Option
Instead of canceling, you may also choose to reschedule your trip at no additional cost.

TravelCove allows one free reschedule up to 48 hours before departure.

This is subject to availability and any price differences due to date changes.

📝 Important Notes
Although TravelCove guarantees full refunds from its side, some third-party services (e.g., airline tickets, attraction passes, or visas) may follow separate refund rules. If non-refundable components are involved, we will clearly inform you in advance at the time of booking.

We are happy to issue credit vouchers instead of refunds if preferred—valid for 12 months from the date of issue.

❤️ Our Commitment
At TravelCove, our goal is to provide you with peace of mind, even when your plans change. We are proud to offer one of the most flexible cancellation policies in the industry, because we believe that your trust is more important than a cancellation fee.


📌 Important Travel Requirements
Passport & Visa
Guests must hold a valid passport with at least 6 months validity from the date of travel.
All visa-related arrangements are the guest's responsibility unless TravelCove has been authorized to handle visa processing.

Travel Insurance
We highly recommend purchasing comprehensive travel insurance that covers medical emergencies, cancellations, lost baggage, and travel delays.

Hotel Check-in & Check-out
Hotel check-in: 3:00 PM, check-out: 12:00 PM (noon). Early check-in or late check-out is subject to hotel availability and may incur additional charges.

Changes in Itinerary
TravelCove may occasionally make adjustments to the itinerary due to weather, safety, or operational requirements. Rest assured, we will always aim to substitute with equal or better quality alternatives without additional cost to you.

Identification Requirements
All travelers must carry a valid government-issued ID and original passport during travel.

🩺 Health & Safety Guidelines
Health Responsibility
Travelers are responsible for ensuring they are physically fit for travel. If you have any chronic health conditions, allergies, or special needs, please inform us at the time of booking.

Vaccinations & COVID-19 Protocols
Compliance with all health entry requirements (including vaccinations or COVID-19 testing) is mandatory and varies by country. TravelCove will notify you of the latest travel advisories.

Emergency Contacts
An emergency contact number is required for every traveler. This ensures we can reach a designated contact in case of unforeseen events.

Activity Participation
Some activities (e.g., dune bashing, amusement rides, water parks) may involve physical exertion or risk. Participation is at your own discretion and risk.

Travel Insurance & Medical Coverage
Medical costs in the UAE can be high. We strongly recommend obtaining travel insurance with comprehensive medical and emergency evacuation coverage.
